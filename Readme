 Project Review: Fusion Feet Dance Studio Website
This project is a well-structured static website built using only HTML. It showcases the Fusion Feet Dance Studio, including a description of dance styles, a video for engagement, a clear class offering list, a comparison table of dance forms, and a registration form link.

Despite being created without CSS or JavaScript, the project delivers clear content and structure, making it a strong foundation for future enhancements.
